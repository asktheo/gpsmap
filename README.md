# gpsmap
Imagine you sample gps data daily from a number of units and you want to visualize them on a map. In the demo the map zooms to the extent of the gps data - displayed as normal WMS layers on top of a base map. But the data is also fetched and ready for an animation which the user can activate by pressing the play button.
